# Machine-Learning-Powered-Intelligent-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

🪙 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning.
It leverages LightGBM, SMOTE (for class imbalance handling), and a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

🚀 Built end-to-end — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment.


🧠 Tech Stack

Python 3.12

LightGBM – high-performance gradient boosting

SMOTE – Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique

scikit-learn – scaling, evaluation, and preprocessing

Streamlit – web app interface

Joblib – model serialization

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/credit-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-fraud-detection


2️⃣ Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # (Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate        # (Windows)

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Train the model
python train_model.py

5️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

🧩 Workflow

Data Loading → Load creditcard.csv

Preprocessing → Standardize data using StandardScaler

Imbalance Handling → Apply SMOTE to balance fraud/non-fraud classes

Model Training → Train LightGBM classifier

Evaluation → View precision, recall, and F1-score

Deployment → Predict transactions using the Streamlit dashboard
